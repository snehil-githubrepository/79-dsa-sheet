# Problem Statement : Median of 2 sorted arrays

---

## _Given two sorted arrays arr1 and arr2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays. The median is defined as the middle value of a sorted list of numbers. In case the length of the list is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements._

```cpp
Example 1:
Input Format: n1 = 3, arr1[] = {2,4,6}, n2 = 3, arr2[] = {1,3,5}
Result: 3.5
Explanation: The array after merging 'a' and 'b' will be { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }. As the length of the merged list is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements. Here two medians are 3 and 4. So the median will be the average of 3 and 4, which is 3.5.
```

```cpp
Example 2:
Input Format: n1 = 3, arr1[] = {2,4,6}, n2 = 2, arr2[] = {1,3}
Result: 3
Explanation: The array after merging 'a' and 'b' will be { 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 }. The median is simply 3.
