# Next Greater Element Algorithm

## Introduction

This algorithm efficiently finds the next greater elements for elements in `nums1` based on `nums2` using a stack and a map.

## Steps

### Create a Map for Next Greater Elements

- Iterate through `nums2` to create a map that stores the next greater element for each element in `nums2`.
- Use a stack to track elements without found next greater elements.
- While iterating through `nums2`:
  - Compare the current element with elements at the top of the stack.
  - If the current element is greater, it becomes the next greater element for the elements at the top of the stack.
  - Store this mapping in the map and continue until no greater element is found or the stack is empty.
  - Push the current element onto the stack.

### Handle Elements Without Next Greater Elements

- After iterating through `nums2`, elements might remain in the stack without a next greater element.
- Pop these elements from the stack and set their next greater element as -1 in the map.

### Retrieve Next Greater Elements for `nums1`

- Iterate through `nums1`.
- For each element in `nums1`, retrieve its corresponding next greater element from the map created in the previous step.
- Store these next greater elements in the result array.

## Usage

To use this algorithm:

- Provide `nums1` and `nums2` arrays as input.
- Call the function implementing this algorithm.
- Retrieve the array of next greater elements for `nums1` as the output.

## Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(N + M)
  - N represents the length of `nums2`.
  - M represents the length of `nums1`.
- Space Complexity: O(N)
  - Additional space used by the stack and map for storing elements and their mappings.

This algorithm efficiently solves the problem by optimizing element comparisons and utilizing data structures to store and retrieve necessary information.
