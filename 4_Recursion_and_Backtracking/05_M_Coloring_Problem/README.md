## Problem Statement : N Queen Problem | Return all Distinct Solutions to the N-Queens Puzzle [HARD]

### _The **n-queens** puzzle is the problem of placing `n` queens on an `n x n` chessboard such that no two queens attack each other. Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the **n-queens puzzle**. You may return the answer in **any order**. Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where `'Q'` and `'.'` both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively._

```cpp
Example 1:

Input: n = 4
Output: [[".Q..","...Q","Q...","..Q."],["..Q.","Q...","...Q",".Q.."]]
```

```cpp
Example 2:

Input: n = 1
Output: [["Q"]]
```
